Link Prediction Experiments
============

**This repository contains a series of machine learning experiments for [link prediction](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/link-pred.pdf) within social networks.** 

We first implement and apply a variety of link prediction methods to each of the ego networks contained within the [SNAP Facebook dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html) and to various [random networks](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generators.html) generated using [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/), and then calculate and compare the ROC AUC, Average Precision, and runtime of each method.

### Link Prediction Methods Tested:
* [(Variational) Graph Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07308): An end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network model for unsupervised learning on graphs
* [Node2Vec/DeepWalk](http://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/): A skip-gram based approach to learning node embeddings from random walks within a given graph
* [Spectral Clustering](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.SpectralEmbedding.html): Using spectral embeddings to create node representations from an adjacency matrix
* [Baseline Indexes](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/algorithms.link_prediction.html): Adamic-Adar, Jaccard Coefficient, Preferential Attachment
